# The Sonic Dash decompilation
If you didn't know, Sonic Dash is an endless runner game created by Hardlight and published by SEGA. This is just a decompilation of the first version of the game released for Android.

As you do or don't know, since this game was made with Unity, you will need Unity to open it. Specifically Unity 2017, since the decompiler I used (uTinyRipper) decompiles projects compatible with Unity 2017. This might not work, especially because I haven't tried this myself.
